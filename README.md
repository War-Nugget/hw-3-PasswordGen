# hw-3-PasswordGen
by Sahil Patel

This password generator was my third homework assignment given to me by Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp. The generator teaches you the basics of arrays, if statements, combining arrays and adding those combines into a randomizer to genrate a random password. These were the steps I have taken to complete this assignment.

## 1. Started with declaring variables.
- Added variables for confirming the criterias for the password (Uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters).
- Created an array for said types of characters.
- The uppercase I found on Stackskills where I can convert the lowercase letter array into an uppercase one.
- Also added spaces as a special characeter.

## 2. Generate Function
- The generate function was given to me and I did some modifications to the code where I added a placeholder and method call.
- The main code is an if function where it prompts you to choose the criteria listed.
- The if statements decide which of the options the user decides to use and combines the arrays using the concat function.
- Finally randomizes the characters for password, combines them into a string and inputs in into the text box.
